# eslint-plugin-jimu-theme

This plug-in is used to assist in migrating jimu-theme variables to the new version.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-jimu-theme`:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-jimu-theme --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `jimu-theme` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "jimu-theme"
    ]
}
```


Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "jimu-theme/rule-name": 2
    }
}
```

## Note

This plugin is only for assisting in `jimu-theme` upgrades and should not be used for other purposes.

The rules `prefer-direct-variables-access` and `no-classic-variables-assignment` are designed to standardize the usage of theme variables, such as:

```
colors.primary => theme.colors.primary
props.theme.colors.primary => theme.colors.primary
palette.primary[100] => theme.colors.palette.primary[100]
border.color => theme.border.color
```

Place it as the first rule in the ruleset.

The `no-classic-*` rules are used to upgrade corresponding variables, for example:

```
theme.colors.primary => theme.sys.color.primary.main
```

In the `eslintrc`, place it after the `prefer-direct-variables-access` rule.

The `no-unnecessary-template-vars` and `no-empty-classname` rules are intended to clean up abnormal code after a theme upgrade, such as:

```
color: ${'transparent'}; => color: transparent;
<div className=''></div> => <div></div>
```

These rules need to be placed after `no-classic-*`.

Furthermore, after automatic fixing, there might still be incorrect code remaining, which requires reviewing each file individually.
We recommend autofixing files one by one rather than applying a global autofix directly.
