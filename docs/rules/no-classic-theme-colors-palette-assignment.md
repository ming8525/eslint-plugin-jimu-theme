# Disallow directly access `theme.colors` or `theme.colors.palette` in variable assignment. Note: This rule is only defined to help theme variable upgrades. It should be called before other rules for upgrading the theme, and should not be used in other scenarios (`jimu-theme/no-classic-theme-colors-palette-assignment`)
